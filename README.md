## What I'm building

### 🪞 Digital Mirror
A direction engine that calculates whether your life is ascending or descending — from conversations you already have with your AI agent.

No forms. No tracking. No manual input. Just talk, and Mirror tells you if you're going up or down across 5 dimensions: Finance, Health, Career, Social, Family.

**Built entirely by me, with Claude Sonnet 4. No computer science degree. No dev team. Just systems thinking and AI.**

## How I build

I can't write a line of code by hand.

I build production systems by understanding architecture, thinking in systems, and working with AI as a development partner. Every file in Digital Mirror — the backend, the scoring engine, the parser, the sidecar watcher, the CI/CD pipeline — was built through conversation with Claude.

This is my first technical project. I shipped it in a weekend.

The barrier to building isn't technical anymore. It never was.

> *"The tools changed. The game changed. Adapt or stay behind."*

## What I believe

The biggest competitive advantage right now isn't knowing how to code.  
It's knowing how to **think clearly enough** to build without coding.

We're at the moment in history where a founder with no technical background can ship a production Node.js backend with rate limiting, API auth, SQLite, systemd services, and GitHub Actions CI — in a weekend.

I'm proof. And I'm just getting started.
